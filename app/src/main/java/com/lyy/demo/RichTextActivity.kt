      "## Scroll handle\n" +
      "\n" +
      "Scroll handle is replacement for **ScrollBar** from 1.x branch.\n" +
      "\n" +
      "From version 2.1.0 putting **PDFView** in **RelativeLayout** to use **ScrollHandle** is not required, you can use any layout.\n" +
      "\n" +
      "To use scroll handle just register it using method `Configurator#scrollHandle()`.\n" +
      "This method accepts implementations of **ScrollHandle** interface.\n" +
      "\n" +
      "There is default implementation shipped with AndroidPdfViewer, and you can use it with\n" +
      "`.scrollHandle(new DefaultScrollHandle(this))`.\n" +
      "**DefaultScrollHandle** is placed on the right (when scrolling vertically) or on the bottom (when scrolling horizontally).\n" +
      "By using constructor with second argument (`new DefaultScrollHandle(this, true)`), handle can be placed left or top.\n" +
      "\n" +
      "You can also create custom scroll handles, just implement **ScrollHandle** interface.\n" +
      "All methods are documented as Javadoc comments on interface [source](https://github.com/barteksc/AndroidPdfViewer/tree/master/android-pdf-viewer/src/main/java/com/github/barteksc/pdfviewer/scroll/ScrollHandle.java).\n" +
      "\n" +
      "## Document sources\n" +
      "Version 2.3.0 introduced _document sources_, which are just providers for PDF documents.\n" +
      "Every provider implements **DocumentSource** interface.\n" +
      "Predefined providers are available in **com.github.barteksc.pdfviewer.source** package and can be used as\n" +
      "samples for creating custom ones.\n" +
      "\n" +
      "Predefined providers can be used with shorthand methods:\n" +
      "```\n" +
      "pdfView.fromUri(Uri)\n" +
      "pdfView.fromFile(File)\n" +
      "pdfView.fromBytes(byte[])\n" +
      "pdfView.fromStream(InputStream)\n" +
      "pdfView.fromAsset(String)\n" +
      "```\n" +
      "Custom providers may be used with `pdfView.fromSource(DocumentSource)` method.\n" +
      "\n" +
      "## Links\n" +
      "Version 3.0.0 introduced support for links in PDF documents. By default, **DefaultLinkHandler**\n" +
      "is used and clicking on link that references page in same document causes jump to destination page\n" +
      "and clicking on link that targets some URI causes opening it in default application.\n" +
      "\n" +
      "You can also create custom link handlers, just implement **LinkHandler** interface and set it using\n" +
      "`Configurator#linkHandler(LinkHandler)` method. Take a look at [DefaultLinkHandler](https://github.com/barteksc/AndroidPdfViewer/tree/master/android-pdf-viewer/src/main/java/com/github/barteksc/pdfviewer/link/DefaultLinkHandler.java)\n" +
      "source to implement custom behavior.\n" +
      "\n" +
      "## Pages fit policy\n" +
      "Since version 3.0.0, library supports fitting pages into the screen in 3 modes:\n" +
      "* WIDTH - width of widest page is equal to screen width\n" +
      "* HEIGHT - height of highest page is equal to screen height\n" +
      "* BOTH - based on widest and highest pages, every page is scaled to be fully visible on screen\n" +
      "\n" +
      "Apart from selected policy, every page is scaled to have size relative to other pages.\n" +
      "\n" +
      "Fit policy can be set using `Configurator#pageFitPolicy(FitPolicy)`. Default policy is **WIDTH**.\n" +
      "\n" +
      "## Additional options\n" +
      "\n" +
      "### Bitmap quality\n" +
      "By default, generated bitmaps are _compressed_ with `RGB_565` format to reduce memory consumption.\n" +
      "Rendering with `ARGB_8888` can be forced by using `pdfView.useBestQuality(true)` method.\n" +
      "\n" +
      "### Double tap zooming\n" +
      "There are three zoom levels: min (default 1), mid (default 1.75) and max (default 3). On first double tap,\n" +
      "view is zoomed to mid level, on second to max level, and on third returns to min level.\n" +
      "If you are between mid and max levels, double tapping causes zooming to max and so on.\n" +
      "\n" +
      "Zoom levels can be changed using following methods:\n" +
      "\n" +
      "``` java\n" +
      "void setMinZoom(float zoom);\n" +
      "void setMidZoom(float zoom);\n" +
      "void setMaxZoom(float zoom);\n" +
      "```\n" +
      "\n" +
      "## Possible questions\n" +
      "### Why resulting apk is so big?\n" +
      "Android PdfViewer depends on PdfiumAndroid, which is set of native libraries (almost 16 MB) for many architectures.\n" +
      "Apk must contain all this libraries to run on every device available on market.\n" +
      "Fortunately, Google Play allows us to upload multiple apks, e.g. one per every architecture.\n" +
      "There is good article on automatically splitting your application into multiple apks,\n" +
      "available [here](http://ph0b.com/android-studio-gradle-and-ndk-integration/).\n" +
      "Most important section is _Improving multiple APKs creation and versionCode handling with APK Splits_, but whole article is worth reading.\n" +
      "You only need to do this in your application, no need for forking PdfiumAndroid or so.\n" +
      "\n" +
      "### Why I cannot open PDF from URL?\n" +
      "Downloading files is long running process which must be aware of Activity lifecycle, must support some configuration, \n" +
      "data cleanup and caching, so creating such module will probably end up as new library.\n" +
      "\n" +
      "### How can I show last opened page after configuration change?\n" +
      "You have to store current page number and then set it with `pdfView.defaultPage(page)`, refer to sample app\n" +
      "\n" +
      "### How can I fit document to screen width (eg. on orientation change)?\n" +
      "Use `FitPolicy.WIDTH` policy or add following snippet when you want to fit desired page in document with different page sizes:\n" +
      "``` java\n" +
      "Configurator.onRender(new OnRenderListener() {\n" +
      "    @Override\n" +
      "    public void onInitiallyRendered(int pages, float pageWidth, float pageHeight) {\n" +
      "        pdfView.fitToWidth(pageIndex);\n" +
      "    }\n" +
      "});\n" +
      "```\n" +
      "\n" +
      "### How can I scroll through single pages like a ViewPager?\n" +
      "You can use a combination of the following settings to get scroll and fling behaviour similar to a ViewPager:\n" +
      "``` java\n" +
      "    .swipeHorizontal(true)\n" +
      "    .pageSnap(true)\n" +
      "    .autoSpacing(true)\n" +
      "    .pageFling(true)\n" +
      "```\n" +
      "\n" +
      "## One more thing\n" +
      "If you have any suggestions on making this lib better, write me, create issue or write some code and send pull request.\n" +
